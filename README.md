# Fedora Setup

A simple bash program to download some of my most used apps and configure them in case my linux distribution breaks (happens sometimes)

## Usage

Since this is a shell script, it is very easy to run. Just type:

```
chmod +x newfedora.sh
./newfedora.sh
```

_Note: make sure you want to do this since it will reboot your computer several times_

## Rebooting

This script will reboot your computer about 2 times. Each time it reboots, run the script again and answer the questions until you answer "yes" to everything.
